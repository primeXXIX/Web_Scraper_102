# Web_Scraper_102
Practice project to build web scraper
## Description
"Web scraping is a technique in data extraction where you pull information from websites."

Goals:

- User can paste a link and select images or links. If the user selects robots, it redirects to shitty robots reddit page
- Functionally: The scraper currently returns JSON, and we want to take that data and format it into a webpage 

## Specifications

Using https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js as a resource, optionally with the same libraries, preferably explore alternative libraries that will still allow you to accomplish the same end result.
- [ ] Complete all the steps in the tutorial.
- [ ] Create a webpage that is populated with the JSON file that is returned from the scrape.
- [ ] Create at least two examples of a populated webpage with scraped data.

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Scrape data from multiple different sources and populate on one page (like a travel booking website).

### Required
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
